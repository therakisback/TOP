This is my repository as I work on "The Odin Project." I wanted to try this set of online lessons to hopefully fill in gaps that I felt my education left, specifically around web developement. I will be aiming for a better understanding of full-stack web development with systems like React and Node.js



It is worth noting that for the course, I will only be using this repo as to avoid lots of bloat on my GitHub account. As I already have enough repositories.

I will also be mostly skimming through the foundations course. I will be reading, but as I have already practiced the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I shouldn't need more than a refresher.
